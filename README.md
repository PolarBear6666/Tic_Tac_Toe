# Tic_Tac_Toe
Java console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game (CS3560 assignment)


# Tic Tac Toe (Java)

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game built in Java.

## Design Rationale
I separated the game into multiple classes so each part has one job:
- Board: stores the game state
- Game: controls the flow of the game
- Player: represents a person or AI
- ConsoleApp: runs the game

## How to Run
1. Open in IntelliJ
2. Run the `ConsoleApp` file
3. Play Tic Tac Toe in your console!

## Example Output
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
